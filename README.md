# Capstone Project 

This project uses the  “Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset” from the UC-Irvine Machine Learning Repository:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset#
Sakar, C.O., Polat, S.O., Katircioglu, M. et al. Neural Comput & Applic (2018)

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes.
Throughout this project, exploratory data analysis is used to determine the effects of attributes on the dependent variable using visualization and other techniques. Clustering techniques also are used to derive business insights. Then, the data is prepared for modeling. Multiple machine learning models are built, evaluation measures are calculated, and model performances are ranked.
